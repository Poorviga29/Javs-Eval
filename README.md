# Javs-Eval
Jarvis Eval is an AI-powered local evaluation system designed to automate the assessment of learners’ Data Science submissions in ML, DL, OpenCV, and LLM tasks. It executes Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and Python scripts (.py) in a secure, sandboxed environment, capturing outputs, logs, and artifacts while enforcing runtime and memory limits.
